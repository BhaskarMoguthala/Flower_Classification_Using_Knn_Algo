# Flower_Classification_Using_Knn_Algo
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the Iris Dataset, which includes 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
